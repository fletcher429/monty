# Monty - Interpreter for Monty ByteCode Files 🚀

Monty is a project that understands Monty ByteCode files, bringing to life a dynamic scripting language environment that works on a unique stack. With Monty, coding feels like going on an adventure! 🌟

## Overview 📜

Monty ByteCode files contain a series of special instructions that the interpreter looks at line by line. Each instruction can change the stack in different ways, giving us lots of ways to work with data. 💫

## Objectives 🎯

Our goal is simple:

- **Do Special Stuff:** Use `push`, `pop`, `pall`, and more to do cool things with the stack.
- **Do Things Right:** Follow the rules and be careful with how we write code.
- **Help Others When They're Stuck:** Give clear messages when things go wrong to help everyone understand.
- **Make a Really Good Interpreter:** Make a tool that can understand Monty ByteCode files really well.

## Features ✨

- **Two Modes:** Choose between stack (LIFO) and queue (FIFO) modes easily.
- **Helpful Error Messages:** Get clear messages to know what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **Using the Normal Stuff:** Use regular C code to make sure everything works smoothly.
- **Easy Debugging:** Use the interpreter to figure out what's happening in Monty ByteCode files.

## Usage 🧙‍♂️

To use Monty:

1. **Get the Interpreter Ready:** Make the code into a program and tell it which Monty ByteCode file to read.
2. **Make Magic Happen:** Tell the interpreter to do its thing and watch the magic unfold.

Monty makes coding feel like casting spells, but with computers instead of wands! 🔮
